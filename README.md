## Issue and Resolutions
### Issue
* Displaying Data to ingredients and measurements on a drink
    * API stored each ingredient and measurement as a different name
    * Example: <br />
![alt text](https://github.com/Bmdawley22/drink-mixer/blob/main/Images/IngredientsAPI.png)

* See Images Folder: IngredientsAPI.png

### Resolution
* Create a for loop to map over in the render
    * Result: Able to create match naming conventions to return the data from the API
    * Cause: adding a for loop at the begining on the page render then map over that array in order to only return results that had a value and not null. This works for both ingredients and measurements
    * Code Used: 
    ```
        let ingredients = [];
        for (let i = 1; i < 16; i++) {
            const temp = `strIngredient${i}`;
            ingredients.push(props.randomDrink[temp]);
        }

        {ingredients.map((ingredient, id) => {
            return (
                <div key={id}>
                    {ingredient ? <li >{ingredient}</li> : null}
                </div>
            )
        })}
    ```

### Issue
* Firebase database to store information
    * Using Firebase database to store all drinks in order to save drinks that are added each time

### Resolution
* Imported firebase and used .ref to store to data base
    * Result: data was saving to the database; however, having difficulites rendering that data to be used throughout the app
    * Cause: adding .ref to store directly to the database
    * Code Used:
    ```
        import firebase from 'firebase';

        const drinks = firebase.database();
        const drink = drinks.ref('drinks');
        for (let i = 0; i < this.state.drinks.length; i++) {
            drink.push({ ...this.state.drinks[i]});
        }
    ```
